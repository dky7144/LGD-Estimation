# LGD-Estimation
LGD stands for Loss given default so it means when a customer at a bank defaults on his loan how much money does the bank lose. The customer might have paid some amount back or nothing at all.
Customer first apply for loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan. In case the borrower doesnâ€™t pay back the loan, the losses are to be incurred by the bank.
Automate the loss estimation on the customer detail provided while applying for car loan. These details are Age, Years of Experience, Number of cars, Gender, Marital Status. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the loss estimation given that the customers is a defaulter, those are eligible for loan amount so that they get to know what features are leading to defaults upto which amount.
Aim is to build predictive models which can be used by bank to determine whether to approve the loan application further or not based on customer details.
